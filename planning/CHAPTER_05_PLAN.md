# Chapter 5 Plan — Status and Greatness

## Objective
Challenge status-seeking and rank with Jesus’ public teaching on childlikeness, last-first inversion, and table placement.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Become Like Children
   - Left (received): “Mature stature earns higher rank.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 18:1–5 (ASV). Context: public setting with the disciples and others nearby.
   - Tension: Rank-seeking maturity vs. statusless childlikeness.
   - Prompts: where you compete for rank; what childlike posture looks like; one lowly act.
   - Practice: Take a low-status task at work/home without announcement.

2. Title: The Last and the First
   - Left: “Aim for first place; winners lead.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Mark 9:33–37; 10:31 (ASV). Public teaching in a house with others present; aphorism repeated.
   - Tension: Upward mobility vs. downward greatness.
   - Prompts: detect your first-place reflex; welcome the least; take the last spot.
   - Practice: Choose the last position in a queue/meeting and serve others’ goals.

3. Title: Choose the Lower Seat
   - Left: “Sit up front; signal importance.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Luke 14:7–11 (ASV). Public meal parable about seats of honor.
   - Tension: Self-promotion vs. humility that lets others lift you.
   - Prompts: map your seat-seeking habits; practice unnoticed humility; let others choose.
   - Practice: Intentionally take the lower seat all week.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 18 (child), Mark 9/10 (teachings to group), Luke 14 (meal parable).
- Left: paraphrases; no copyrighted quotes.

## Risks
- Misreading humility as self‑erasure → highlight agency and service, not worthlessness.
- Overlap with Ch1 themes → focus on status signals, seats, and childlikeness distinct from authority.

## DoD for Chapter 5
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; “public‑only” verified by two reviewers.
