# Chapter 2 Plan — Enemies and Retaliation

## Objective
Invite readers to examine common retaliation/tribal assumptions against Jesus’ public teaching on enemy‑love, non‑retaliation, and neighborliness.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Love Your Enemies
   - Left (received): “Protect your own; enemies deserve what they get.” (paraphrase; common maxim)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:43–48 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.
   - Tension: Preferential love vs. indiscriminate love.
   - Prompts: who is “enemy” for you; what does prayer change; practice concrete goodwill.
   - Practice: Daily prayer/blessing for one opponent; one tangible good deed.

2. Title: Non‑Retaliation
   - Left: “Stand your ground; respond in kind to deter harm.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matt 5:38–42 (ASV). Public Sermon teaching.
   - Tension: Lex talionis vs. creative, non‑coercive response.
   - Prompts: where you escalate; what dignity‑preserving alternative exists; test one.
   - Practice: Replace one retaliatory habit with a second‑mile action all week.

3. Title: Who Is My Neighbor?
   - Left: “Help your own first; outsiders aren’t your responsibility.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Luke 10:29–37 (ASV). Public exchange with a lawyer; parable.
   - Tension: Boundary‑limited care vs. mercy‑defined neighbor.
   - Prompts: identify your “Samaritan/outsider”; map resources you can share; choose a next step.
   - Practice: One act of mercy toward an out‑group person this week.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 5 (Sermon), Luke 10 (public dialogue).
- Left: paraphrases; no copyrighted quotes without permission.

## Risks
- “Resist not” misread as passivity → include context note on creative, non‑coercive responses.
- Politicization → keep examples interpersonal and local.

## DoD for Chapter 2
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; “public‑only” checked by two reviewers.
