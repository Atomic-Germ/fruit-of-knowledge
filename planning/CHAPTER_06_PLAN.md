# Chapter 6 Plan — Anxiety and Trust

## Objective
Contrast worry-as-responsibility with Jesus’ public teaching on trustful attention, asking/seeking, and reframing fear.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Do Not Be Anxious
   - Left (received): “If you’re not worried, you’re not paying attention.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 6:25–34 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.
   - Tension: Anxiety as virtue vs. trustful focus on today.
   - Prompts: name core fears; notice provision signs; choose today’s task.
   - Practice: Daily worry release + one seek-first action.

2. Title: Ask, Seek, Knock
   - Left: “Self-reliance only; don’t ask for help.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matt 7:7–11 (ASV). Public Sermon teaching.
   - Tension: Closed self-sufficiency vs. open-hearted petition.
   - Prompts: identify where you won’t ask; whom you can ask; take one asking step.
   - Practice: Make one honest ask each day this week.

3. Title: Fear and Courage
   - Left: “Fear keeps you safe; avoid storms.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matt 14:27; Mark 6:50 (ASV) public miracle scenes with crowds/disciples seeing; and Luke 12:4–7 (ASV) public teaching on fear.
   - Tension: Safety-first fear vs. courage rooted in care/value.
   - Prompts: name a storm; hear “be not afraid”; take one courageous step.
   - Practice: Choose one feared action and do a small version safely.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 6–7 (Sermon), Luke 12 (crowd teaching), note visibility in miracle scenes.
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Overlap with Ch3 provision → focus anxiety as posture; use ask/seek and courage angle.
- Misuse of “do not fear” → avoid shaming; center care and practical steps.

## DoD for Chapter 6
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; “public‑only” check by two reviewers.
