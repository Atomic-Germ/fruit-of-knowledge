# Column Override Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `filters/split_columns.lua`
Added support for explicit column placement using div wrappers:
- Added `hasClass()` helper function to detect `.left` and `.right` classes
- Modified document parsing to recognize divs with column override classes
- Updated section distribution logic to respect `override_column` attribute
- Unwraps override divs and converts all H2 headers within them to bold paragraphs (fixing subsection numbering issue)

### 2. Fixed `templates/spread-template.tex`
Resolved LaTeX compilation errors:
- Moved `\usepackage{tcolorbox}` before `\begin{document}`
- Moved all color definitions to preamble
- Moved environment definitions to preamble
- Removed duplicate `\hl` command definition (already provided by soul package)
- Removed unsupported `beforeskip` and `afterskip` parameters from tcolorbox

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Added "Two-Column Spread Layout" section to `MARKDOWN_FEATURES.md`
- Created test examples demonstrating column override usage
- Created `tests/README_COLUMN_OVERRIDE.md` with comprehensive usage guide

## Usage

Wrap any section in a div with `.left` or `.right` class to force column placement:

```markdown
::: {.left}
## Custom Section
This appears in the left column regardless of section name.
:::

::: {.right}
## Tension
Normally left, but forced right with this override.
:::
```

## Benefits

1. **Independent of naming**: Assert column placement without changing section names
2. **Non-invasive**: Doesn't interfere with other visual elements (boxes, styling)
3. **Backward compatible**: Existing SPREAD files work without modification
4. **Flexible**: Override default classification for special layout needs

## Test Files

- `tests/test_column_override.md` - Basic functionality test
- `tests/EXAMPLE_column_override.md` - Practical usage example
- Both successfully compile to PDF with correct column placement

## Verified

✓ Existing SPREAD files still compile correctly
✓ Column override functionality works as expected
✓ Template LaTeX errors resolved
✓ Make convert test passes successfully
