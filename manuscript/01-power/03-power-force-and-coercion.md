# Power, Force, and Coercion

## Received Teaching
> "For the good of the many, ends can justify force."
- Source: Common rationale in institutional and civic contexts
- Context: Coercion framed as necessary for order or safety.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"
- Reference: Matthew 26:52–54 (ASV)
- Context: Public arrest scene before a crowd.

> "But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you. To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also. Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
- Reference: Luke 6:27–31 (ASV)
- Context: Public Sermon.

## Tension
Instrumental force vs. non‑retaliating love.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Name a situation where force or leverage feels necessary to you.
2. Empathize: Imagine the perspective and fear of the other party.
3. Act: Replace one coercive tactic (threat, pressure) with a surprising service.

## Practice
Identify a recurring power struggle and pilot one week of non‑coercive, service‑first responses.

## Notes
- Pair arrest-scene restraint with general public teaching to avoid proof‑texting.
