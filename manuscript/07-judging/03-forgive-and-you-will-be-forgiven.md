# Forgive and You Will Be Forgiven

## Received Teaching
> "Some things are unforgivable; cut them off forever."
- Source: Hard-boundary protection logic
- Context: Mercy withheld to maintain safety/control.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released: give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again."
- Reference: Luke 6:37–38 (ASV) Sermon on the Plain, public.

> Optional echo: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34, ASV variant reading)
- Context: Public crucifixion scene.

## Tension
Scorekeeping vs. the measure you use returning to you.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where are you withholding mercy?
2. Empathize: If you received the same measure, what would return to you?
3. Act: Offer one undeserved mercy and adjust your “measure.”

## Practice
Choose a mercy act toward someone you’ve written off.

## Notes
- Note textual variation of Luke 23:34; keep it optional.
