# Judge Not, First Examine Yourself

## Received Teaching
> "Call out wrong to uphold standards."
- Source: Accountability maxim
- Context: Quick external critique justified as duty.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
- Reference: Matthew 7:1–5 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Policing others vs. removing your own beam first.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you most quickly judge others?
2. Empathize: What is an equivalent “beam” in your own life?
3. Act: Correct one personal fault before offering critique.

## Practice
Before one critique each day, fix a related fault of your own first.

## Notes
- Measure/reciprocity principle foregrounded.
