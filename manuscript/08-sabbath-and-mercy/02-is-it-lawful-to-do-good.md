# Is It Lawful To Do Good?

## Received Teaching
> "Sabbath prohibits work of any kind; helping is an exception only in extreme cases." (paraphrase)
- Context: A legalistic reading that treats rest as absolute and prioritizes rule purity.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save life, or to destroy it?" (Mark 3:4 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 3:1–6 (ASV)
- Context: Synagogue setting; Jesus heals a man with a withered hand in public while opponents watch and later conspire against him.

## Tension
An absolutist prohibition against work versus choosing to do good as the Sabbath's priority.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where have you hesitated to help because of fear of breaking a norm or rule?
2. Empathize: Who is made worse off by withholding help to avoid a minor infraction?
3. Act: Identify one concrete situation this week where you will choose to do good despite inconvenience.

## Practice
Pick one small, inconvenient act of care (bring a meal, offer a needed ride, do a quick repair) and intentionally do it when you otherwise would have shielded yourself behind the rule.

## Notes
- Right text: Mark 3:1–6 (ASV). Pericope context: public synagogue confrontation and healing.
- Left source: paraphrase; permission: none.
