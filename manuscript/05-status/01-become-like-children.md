# Become Like Children

## Received Teaching
> "Mature stature earns higher rank."
- Source: Rank and seniority assumptions
- Context: Advancement equated with superiority.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me."
- Reference: Matthew 18:1–5 (ASV)
- Context: Teaching with others present.

## Tension
Rank-seeking maturity vs. statusless childlikeness.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you signal maturity to claim rank?
2. Empathize: What would humble, childlike posture look like in your context?
3. Act: Take one lowly task that benefits others.

## Practice
Choose a behind-the-scenes task this week and do it quietly.

## Notes
- Keep focus on humility and reception of the small.
