# The Widow’s Gift

## Received Teaching
> "The amount matters most."
- Source: Fundraising emphasis on totals
- Context: Large sums equated with impact.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury: for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living."
- Reference: Mark 12:41–44 (ASV); cf. Luke 21:1–4 (ASV)
- Context: Public temple observation; teaching to listeners.

## Tension
Sum given vs. cost to the giver.

## Reflection
1. Observe: What percent of your giving is from surplus vs. sacrifice?
2. Empathize: How do small, costly gifts feel to give and receive?
3. Act: Choose a proportion that you can feel this month.

## Practice
Set a percent-based gift that slightly hurts and give it quietly.

## Notes
- Keep focus on proportion/sacrifice, not totals.
