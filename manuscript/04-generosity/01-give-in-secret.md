# Give in Secret

## Received Teaching
> "Public generosity inspires others; make it visible."
- Source: Common philanthropy messaging
- Context: Visibility used for inspiration and signaling.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."
- Reference: Matthew 6:1–4 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Performative giving vs. hidden mercy.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you signal generosity for recognition?
2. Empathize: How might secrecy change the recipient’s experience and your motive?
3. Act: Plan one meaningful anonymous gift this week.

## Practice
Make one significant gift anonymously; tell no one.

## Notes
- Clarify secrecy targets self-promotion, not accountability.
