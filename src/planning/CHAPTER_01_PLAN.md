# Chapter 1 Plan — Power and Authority

## Objective
Juxtapose institutional/assumed views of power with Jesus’ public teaching on authority as servanthood.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Greatness Redefined
   - Left (received): “Leaders must exercise authority to maintain order.” (generic maxim; PD paraphrase). Representative sources: catechism sections on church governance; leadership handbooks.
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 20:25–28; Mark 10:42–45 (ASV). Context: to the Twelve, but in public hearing en route to Jerusalem with other followers present.
   - Tension: From ruling over to serving under.
   - Prompts: observe power verbs; empathize with the last in line; act by choosing a hidden service.
   - Practice: One week of unnoticed service for those with less status at work/home.

2. Title: Authority vs. Status
   - Left: “Titles confer spiritual authority.” (paraphrase); examples: honorifics, seat of honor customs.
   - Right: Matt 23:8–12 (ASV). Public words to crowds and disciples.
   - Tension: Status titles vs. leveling language of siblings.
   - Prompts: where do you seek recognition; who is invisible; what is a concrete way to lower yourself.
   - Practice: Drop one title/honor habit for a week; prioritize listening.

3. Title: Power, Force, and Coercion
   - Left: “For the good of the many, ends can justify force.” (paraphrase of common rationale).
   - Right: Matt 26:52–54 (ASV, public arrest scene) plus Luke 6:27–31 (ASV, public Sermon).
   - Tension: Instrumental force vs. non‑retaliating love.
   - Prompts: name a situation where force feels necessary; imagine the other side’s fear; design a non‑coercive next step.
   - Practice: Replace one coercive tactic (threat, leverage) with a service action.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV/KJV/WEB texts; cite verses and pericopes; confirm “public” setting:
  - Matt 20:25–28; Mark 10:42–45 (public teaching context while traveling; others present)
  - Matt 23:1–12 (to crowds and disciples)
  - Matt 26:47–56 (arrest scene before a crowd); Luke 6:27–31 (Sermon on the Plain/Mount, public)
- Left: use paraphrases or PD materials; avoid copyrighted quotes unless permissions obtained.

## Risks
- “Public-only” ambiguity for Matt 20 setting → add brief note on audience; keep to ASV wording.
- Coercion topic can read political → anchor to interpersonal practice examples.

## DoD for Chapter 1
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; dual review on “public” criterion; sensitivity pass on tone.
