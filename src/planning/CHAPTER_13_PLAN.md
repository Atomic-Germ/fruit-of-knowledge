# Chapter 13 Plan — Purity and Compassion

## Objective
Contrast purity‑driven boundary maintenance and ritual correctness with Jesus’ public teaching that centers compassion, mercy, and the restoration of persons over ritual exclusion.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: What Defiles a Person?
   - Left (received): “Ritual purity is the primary measure of holiness.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 7:14–23 (ASV). Context: public teaching about what truly defiles a person (comes from the heart rather than external washings).
   - Tension: Ritual‑centered holiness vs. heart‑centered ethics that prioritize compassion.
   - Prompts: Which purity rules govern your social boundaries? Where do those rules obscure people’s needs? Where would a compassion‑led exception look like?
   - Practice: For one week, in one setting, prioritize a compassionate exception to a routine purity boundary and reflect on outcomes.

2. Title: The Woman Who Loved Much
   - Left (received): “Sexual or social impurity disqualifies a person from mercy.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 7:36–50 (ASV). Context: public meal scene in a Pharisee's house where Jesus interprets the woman's actions as evidence of forgiven love.
   - Tension: Exclusion for perceived impurity vs. offering mercy to the visibly broken.
   - Prompts: Who do you tacitly disqualify from mercy? What story would change if you gave them the benefit of the doubt? Identify a small merciful act.
   - Practice: Perform a small, sacrificial act of mercy toward someone whom your community often shames.

3. Title: Pharisee, Tax‑Collector — Reformer or Repenter?
   - Left (received): “Ritual observance proves moral superiority.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 18:9–14 (ASV). Context: public parable contrasting self‑righteous prayer and humble repentance.
   - Tension: Prideful purity vs. humble repentance that invites restoration.
   - Prompts: Where do you default to moral posturing? What would contrite admission look like in your context? Take one step toward humility.
   - Practice: Offer one genuine, humble admission of a small failing to a trusted person.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Mark 7:14–23; Luke 7:36–50; Luke 18:9–14). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Overemphasizing mercy to the neglect of accountability — include guidance on safety, repentance, and restorative practices.
- Using John 8 (woman caught in adultery) is tempting but textually and contextually complex; prefer Luke and Mark pericopes.

## DoD for Chapter 13
- Three spreads drafted with PD verse refs, concise context notes, three reflection prompts, and one micro‑practice each; public‑only criterion verified by two reviewers.
