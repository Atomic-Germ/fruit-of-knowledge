# Chapter 10 Plan — Oaths and Truthfulness

## Objective
Contrast cultural reliance on formal oaths, technical evasions, and rhetorical hedging with Jesus’ public teaching that calls for straightforward, trustworthy speech rooted in a truthful heart.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Let Your Yes Be Yes
   - Left (received): “Oaths and legal guarantees are necessary because ordinary speech is unreliable.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:33–37 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public teaching about speech and oaths.
   - Tension: Contractual/legal security vs. integrity that needs no oath.
   - Prompts: When do you feel the need to add extra guarantees to your words? What would change if you trained yourself to speak plainly? Where can you practice a simple, binding yes/no?
   - Practice: Make one clear, unqualified commitment this week and follow through without added caveats.

2. Title: Oaths as Loopholes
   - Left (received): “Careful wording protects reputation and reduces liability.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 23:16–22 (ASV). Context: public indictment of scribal oath‑games that evade responsibility.
   - Tension: Legalistic speechcraft vs. direct accountability.
   - Prompts: In what contexts do you use qualifying language to avoid responsibility? How might a straightforward alternative sound? Try it in a low‑risk setting.
   - Practice: For one week, replace a habitual qualifying phrase (e.g., “I think,” “probably”) with precise language in a chosen relationship.

3. Title: Fruitful Speech
   - Left (received): “Polished rhetoric masks internal instability.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 6:43–45 (ASV). Context: public teaching on how speech flows from the heart and reveals character.
   - Tension: Relying on form vs. cultivating the inner life that yields honest words.
   - Prompts: What does your usual speech reveal about your priorities? Which habitual phrase reveals fear or avoidance? What single small interior practice would make your speech more truthful?
   - Practice: For three days, note one recurring hedging phrase and replace it with a clear alternative.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Matt 5:33–37; Matt 23:16–22; Luke 6:43–45). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok).
- Left: paraphrases; avoid copyrighted quotations without permission.

## Risks
- Oversimplifying the role of legal oaths in formal contracts and civic life; include a note distinguishing everyday speech integrity from formal legal requirements.
- Cultural variations in rhetoric and politeness — adapt practices for context.

## DoD for Chapter 10
- Three spreads drafted with PD verse refs, concise context notes, three reflection prompts, and one micro‑practice each; public‑only criterion verified.
