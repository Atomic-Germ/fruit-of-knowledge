# Chapter 10 Plan — Outsiders and Inclusion

## Objective
Encourage readers to notice boundary‑keeping habits in congregations and everyday life, then compare them with Jesus’ public teaching that intentionally crosses social and ethnic boundaries to welcome the marginalized.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Eating with Sinners
   - Left (received): “We keep company with those like us; outsiders are a liability.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 9:10–13 (ASV). Context: public meal with tax‑collectors and sinners; Pharisees criticize Jesus for associating with the marginalized.
   - Tension: Protecting the in‑group vs. table fellowship that invites the excluded.
   - Prompts: Who are the ‘sinners’ you avoid? What small risk could invite them in? What would hospitality cost you?
   - Practice: Share one simple, unrecorded meal or conversation with a person outside your usual social circle.

2. Title: Lost and Found (Parables of Recompense)
   - Left (received): “Belonging is earned by proving worth or conformity.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 15:1–7; 11–32 (ASV). Context: Jesus tells these parables in public in response to murmuring about his receiving sinners.
   - Tension: Merit‑based membership vs. merciful outreach to those already lost to the group.
   - Prompts: Who is ‘lost’ to your community? What would a welcoming party for them look like? Identify one practical outreach step.
   - Practice: Carry out one low‑cost gesture of welcome toward someone who’s been excluded or ignored.

3. Title: Welcoming Children and the Lowly
   - Left (received): “Children and low‑status people wait their turn and should not disrupt leaders.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 10:13–16; Matt 19:13–15 (ASV). Context: public scene where Jesus rebukes disciples who would send children away and blesses them.
   - Tension: Order‑first hospitality vs. radical welcome that centers the overlooked.
   - Prompts: Who is routinely sidelined in your gatherings? How would you rearrange a meeting to center them? What small change might reallocate honor?
   - Practice: Reconfigure one meeting or social moment to intentionally center someone normally marginalized.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Matt 9:10–13; Luke 15; Mark 10:13–16). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok).
- Left: paraphrases; avoid copyrighted quotations without permission.

## Risks
- Inclusion can be misconstrued as abandonment of healthy boundaries; include guidance about safety and accountability.
- Significant overlap with other chapters (Generosity, Enemies) — keep this chapter focused on boundaries and table fellowship.

## DoD for Chapter 9
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter sketches, PD verse refs, concise context notes, three reflection prompts, and one micro‑practice each; public‑only classification verified by two reviewers.
