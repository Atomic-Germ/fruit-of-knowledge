# Chapter 8 Plan — Sabbath and Mercy

## Objective
Contrast rule-keeping and burdening traditions with Jesus’ public teaching that centers people, mercy, and doing good on the Sabbath.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Sabbath for People
   - Left (received): “Rules first; Sabbath means strict rest regardless of need.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 2:27–28 (ASV) "The sabbath was made for man…" within the grainfields dispute.
   - Tension: Rule-centered Sabbath vs. human-centered mercy.
   - Prompts: whom do rules serve; what need is present; how to center people.
   - Practice: Meet one concrete human need that collides with a rule-bound habit.

2. Title: Is It Lawful To Do Good?
   - Left: “No work means no exceptions.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Mark 3:1–6 (ASV) or Luke 6:6–11 (ASV): "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm?" Synagogue, public.
   - Tension: Non-action compliance vs. active mercy.
   - Prompts: where you withhold help to stay compliant; name the harm of inaction; choose good.
   - Practice: Take one deliberate act of help when it’s inconvenient.

3. Title: Mercy, Not Sacrifice
   - Left: “Ritual/sacrifice outranks mercy.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matthew 12:1–8 (ASV) with 12:7 "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice" (Hosea quoted), public controversy.
   - Tension: Sacrificial correctness vs. merciful interpretation.
   - Prompts: where ritual wins over care; what mercy looks like here; adjust practice.
   - Practice: Replace one ritualized habit with a merciful action this week.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts; confirm public settings: Mark 2–3 (crowd/synagogue disputes), Matthew 12 (public controversy).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Overlap with previous chapters → focus on Sabbath-specific mercy and public disputes.
- Misread as antinomian → frame as intended purpose of Sabbath, not lawlessness.

## DoD for Chapter 8
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; “public‑only” verified by two reviewers.
