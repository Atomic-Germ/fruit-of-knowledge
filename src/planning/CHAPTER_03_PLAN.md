# Chapter 3 Plan — Money and Possessions

## Objective
Explore assumptions about security, status, and accumulation against Jesus’ public teaching on treasure, trust, and enough.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Treasure and Loyalty
   - Left (received): “Build financial security first; give when you can.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 6:19–24 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.
   - Tension: Security-through-accumulation vs. loyalty to a different treasure.
   - Prompts: where your heart follows money; what you actually serve; one reallocation.
   - Practice: Re-route one discretionary expense to quiet generosity this week.

2. Title: Anxiety and Provision
   - Left: “Worry is responsible; planning requires constant vigilance.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matt 6:25–34 (ASV). Public Sermon teaching.
   - Tension: Anxiety-driven control vs. trust with focused action.
   - Prompts: name your core provision fear; notice lilies/birds equivalents; choose today’s task.
   - Practice: Daily practice of naming worry, then one concrete seek-first action.

3. Title: The Rich Fool and ‘Enough’
   - Left: “Maximize returns; bigger stores mean safety.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Luke 12:13–21 (ASV). Public: from the crowd, followed by parable to listeners.
   - Tension: Life-in-abundance vs. life-in-possessions.
   - Prompts: define ‘enough’; where barns grow; one act of redistribution.
   - Practice: Share or sell one stored surplus item and give proceeds quietly.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 6 (Sermon), Luke 12:13 (crowd address).
- Left: paraphrases, no copyrighted quotes unless permissions obtained.

## Risks
- Misreading “do not worry” as irresponsibility → pair with “seek first” concrete actions.
- Prosperity readings → center on loyalty and mercy, not prosperity metrics.
