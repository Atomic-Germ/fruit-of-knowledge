# Chapter 12 Plan — Violence and Peace

## Objective
Contrast cultural acceptance of violence as problem‑solving with Jesus’ public teaching that prizes peacemaking, non‑violence, and creative confrontation.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Turn the Other Cheek
   - Left (received): “Deterrence and retaliation keep societies safe.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:38–42 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public teaching on responses to insult and injury.
   - Tension: Escalation-based security vs. non‑retaliatory alternatives.
   - Prompts: Where do you default to deterrence? What non‑coercive option could be tried? Pick one to attempt and note the outcome.
   - Practice: Refrain from an escalation this week and practice a dignity‑preserving response instead.

2. Title: Blessed Are The Peacemakers
   - Left (received): “Peace at all costs; avoid necessary confrontation.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:9 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount blessing peacemakers; public audience.
   - Tension: Avoiding conflict vs. engaging in peacemaking that can require courageous justice.
   - Prompts: When have you avoided necessary peacemaking? Who could you take a conciliatory step toward? Plan a concrete peacemaking action.
   - Practice: Initiate one conversation aiming at reconciliation or clarity, with a peacemaking posture.

3. Title: Violence and the Kingdom
   - Left (received): “Might makes right; power secures the order.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): John 18:36 (ASV) — "My kingdom is not of this world" (public exchange before Pilate); and Matt 26:52 (ASV) on Bearer of swords, "for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword" (public arrest scene).
   - Tension: Political sovereignty through force vs. a different kingdom ethic that rejects state violence as primary.
   - Prompts: Where do you assume force is the final answer? What alternative frameworks could guide action? Name one policy/relationship you'll reconsider through a kingdom lens.
   - Practice: Replace one advocacy for force with a practical support action (e.g., fund community mediation) for a month.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Matt 5:38–42; Matt 5:9; John 18:36; Matt 26:52). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok where applicable).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Political misapplication — keep the focus on interpersonal and community cases where possible; provide a note distinguishing personal non‑violence from public policy debates.
- Using John 18 scenes carefully due to trial context — note audience and setting.

## DoD for Chapter 12
- Three spreads drafted with PD verse refs, concise context notes, three reflection prompts, and one micro‑practice each; public‑only criterion verified by two reviewers.
