# Chapter 11 Plan — Hypocrisy and Show

## Objective
Expose the gap between performative piety and genuine interior practice, aligning common critiques with Jesus’ public condemnations of hypocrisy and showy religiosity.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Outward Piety, Inward Decay
   - Left (received): “Visible piety proves devotion.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 23:25–28 (ASV). Context: public denunciation of scribes and Pharisees before crowds.
   - Tension: Performative religion vs. inward purity and consistency.
   - Prompts: Where do you seek visible markers of devotion? What private practice might mirror public acts? Choose one to align.
   - Practice: For one week, convert one public religious display into a private, unnoticed discipline.

2. Title: Clean the Inside First
   - Left (received): “Reforms must be shown to be believed.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 11:39–41 (ASV). Context: public teaching about outward cleanliness vs. inner corruption.
   - Tension: External reform signals vs. internal moral work.
   - Prompts: Where have you tidied the outside but ignored the inside? What internal habit requires tending? Begin one small interior repair.
   - Practice: Keep a daily jot in a private journal of one interior habit you intentionally attended to.

3. Title: Humility Over Display
   - Left (received): “Public virtue is a path to influence.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 18:9–14 (ASV) public parable contrasting Pharisee and tax collector in prayer.
   - Tension: Instrumentalized virtue vs. humility that restores relationship.
   - Prompts: Which forms of virtue are strategic for you? How does humility reframe your posture? Take one small humbling action in a group.
   - Practice: Offer an unaggrandized thank-you or admission of mistake in a public setting.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Matt 23; Luke 11; Luke 18:9–14). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Painting criticism as contempt rather than invitation to interior work — keep prompts invitational and non‑accusatory.
- Cultural differences in acceptable transparency — adapt practices accordingly.
