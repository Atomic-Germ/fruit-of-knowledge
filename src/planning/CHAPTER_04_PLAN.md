# Chapter 4 Plan — Generosity and Secrecy

## Objective
Contrast performative charity and recognition-seeking with Jesus’ public teaching on hidden generosity, value from sacrifice, and inviting those who cannot repay.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Give in Secret
   - Left (received): “Public generosity inspires others; make it visible.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 6:1–4 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.
   - Tension: Performative giving vs. hidden mercy.
   - Prompts: where you signal generosity; how secrecy changes motive; one anonymous gift.
   - Practice: Make one meaningful gift anonymously this week.

2. Title: The Widow’s Gift
   - Left: “The amount matters most.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Mark 12:41–44 or Luke 21:1–4 (ASV). Public temple observation with teaching to listeners.
   - Tension: Sum given vs. cost to the giver.
   - Prompts: define “sacrifice” in your budget; notice small costly gifts; choose proportionate giving.
   - Practice: Set a percent-based gift that you feel.

3. Title: Invite the Unreturning
   - Left: “Invite those who can help you back; network wisely.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Luke 14:12–14 (ASV). Spoken at a public dinner among guests.
   - Tension: Reciprocity networking vs. hospitality toward those who cannot repay.
   - Prompts: list those you rarely invite; plan a meal including the overlooked; do it quietly.
   - Practice: Host one meal/act for people who cannot repay.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 6 (Sermon), Mark 12/Luke 21 (temple), Luke 14 (public meal among guests).
- Left: paraphrases; avoid copyrighted quotes unless permission secured.

## Risks
- Reward language in texts → maintain neutral tone; focus prompts on motive and mercy.
- “Secret giving” misread as anti-transparency → clarify target is self-promotion, not accountability.
