# Chapter 14 Plan — Leadership and Service

## Objective
Rethink conventional leadership that privileges rank and control by exploring Jesus’ public teaching that reframes greatness as humble service and mutual care.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Greatness as Service
   - Left (received): “Effective leaders must wield authority and direct outcomes.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 10:42–45; Matt 20:25–28 (ASV). Context: public teaching while traveling and in response to requests for status.
   - Tension: Command‑and‑control leadership vs. servant leadership that seeks others’ good.
   - Prompts: What leadership habits assume control? Where could service be substituted for command? Identify a leadership task to do without directing.
   - Practice: For one week, accept a task you would normally delegate and perform it as service.

2. Title: The Last Shall Be First
   - Left (received): “Leaders earn favor by upward mobility and visibility.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 9:33–37; Matt 18:1–5 (ASV). Context: public disputes about status and Jesus' public re‑framing with children as an example.
   - Tension: Visibility-driven advancement vs. inversion of status that privileges the lowly.
   - Prompts: Where do you seek visibility to lead? How might leadership look different if defined by service? Try one low‑visibility leadership act.
   - Practice: Lead by attending — take a listening role in one meeting and surface others’ ideas.

3. Title: Take Up Your Cross (Follow with Care)
   - Left (received): “Leadership requires self‑promotion and sacrifice for personal glory.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Mark 8:34–38 (ASV). Context: public teaching called to the crowd and disciples about discipleship, self‑denial, and costly following.
   - Tension: Self‑promotional sacrifice vs. sacrificial service aimed at others’ flourishing.
   - Prompts: Which sacrifices are for status versus for others’ benefit? What does disciplined service look like in your role? Commit to one sacrificial, service‑oriented act.
   - Practice: Take one sustained, unpopular task for the common good without seeking recognition for one week.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Mark 10:42–45; Matt 20:25–28; Mark 9:33–37; Matt 18:1–5; Mark 8:34–38). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok where applicable).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Encouraging self‑harmful martyrdom — include boundaries and guidance for sustainable service.
- Overlap with chapters on status and power — keep focus on leadership practices, institutional roles, and daily pastoral/life leadership acts.

## DoD for Chapter 14
- Three spreads drafted with PD verse refs, concise context notes, reflection prompts, and micro‑practices; public‑only classification verified by two reviewers.
