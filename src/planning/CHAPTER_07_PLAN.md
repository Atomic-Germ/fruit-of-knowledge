# Chapter 7 Plan — Judging and Forgiving

## Objective
Invite readers to trade policing others for rigorous self‑examination and proactive reconciliation, aligned with Jesus’ public teaching on judgment and mercy.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Judge Not, First Examine Yourself
   - Left (received): “Call out wrong to uphold standards.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 7:1–5 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.
   - Tension: Policing others vs. removing your own beam first.
   - Prompts: where you judge quickly; beam inventory; one correction before any critique.
   - Practice: Before offering critique once per day, fix one of your own related faults.

2. Title: Reconcile First
   - Left: “Worship/mission comes first; conflicts can wait.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Matt 5:23–26 (ASV). Public Sermon teaching about leaving your gift to reconcile; settle quickly.
   - Tension: Ritual priority vs. relationship repair.
   - Prompts: who comes to mind at the altar; what step toward peace; act within 24 hours.
   - Practice: Do one concrete reconciliation step before your next gathering.

3. Title: Forgive and You Will Be Forgiven
   - Left: “Some things are unforgivable; cut them off forever.” (paraphrase)
   - Right: Luke 6:37–38 (ASV) public teaching; optionally echo Luke 23:34 (ASV) public crucifixion prayer, pre‑resurrection.
   - Tension: Scorekeeping vs. the measure you use returning to you.
   - Prompts: identify a withheld mercy; imagine receiving the same measure; choose a mercy act.
   - Practice: Offer one undeserved mercy and adjust your “measure” this week.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts with verse refs; confirm public settings: Matt 5 & 7 (Sermon on the Mount), Luke 6 (Sermon on the Plain), Luke 23:34 (public crucifixion scene).
- Left: paraphrases only; avoid copyrighted quotes without permission.

## Risks
- Confusing “judge not” with abandoning discernment → emphasize self‑examination and constructive repair.
- Using Luke 23:34 where textual notes vary → mark as optional echo; anchor core teaching in Luke 6.

## DoD for Chapter 7
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter, citations, prompts, and practices; “public‑only” verified by two reviewers; optional echo clearly labeled.
