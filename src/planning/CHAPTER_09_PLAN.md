# Chapter 9 Plan — Oaths and Truthfulness

## Objective
Contrast a received reliance on formal oaths, vows, and legal guarantees (as the primary means of securing truth) with Jesus' public teaching that calls for plainspoken integrity, caution about using sacred things as leverage, and cultivating trust through consistent speech and character.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Say Yes, Say No
   - Left (received): "Oaths and vows are necessary to guarantee truth; people only trust promises sealed by an oath." (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:33–37 (ASV) "But I say unto you... let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay." (Sermon on the Mount)
   - Tension: Formal oath‑making as the source of reliability versus simple, habitual truthfulness.
   - Prompts: When do you add an oath to make speech believable? Who benefits from formal guarantees? How would you practice clearer, ordinary honesty?
   - Practice: For three days, avoid oath‑language ("I swear," "I promise on...") and practice making and keeping small commitments without extra guarantees.

2. Title: Oaths, Power, and Manipulation
   - Left (received): "Invoking sacred witnesses or ritual guarantees protects agreements and enforces social order." (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 23:16–22 (ASV) "Ye blind guides... who swear by the gold of the temple..." (public rebuke of scribal abuse of oaths)
   - Tension: Using oaths as social/legal leverage versus locating trust in conscience and accountable relationships.
   - Prompts: Who gains authority when oaths are required? Who is excluded or harmed by oath‑based systems? Where have you seen oaths used to evade responsibility?
   - Practice: In a situation where invoking a witness or sacred guarantee seems customary, intentionally state your commitment plainly without invoking external leverage; observe the response.

3. Title: Trust Without Formality
   - Left (received): "Contracts, witnesses, and formal vows are the primary safeguards of truth in relationships and institutions." (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 5:37 (ASV) "But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." (Sermon on the Mount)
   - Tension: Reliance on contractual/legal safeguards versus cultivating reliability through consistent character and straightforward speech.
   - Prompts: Recall a time someone kept their word without formal guarantees—what made that possible? How does your context rely on contracts vs relationships? What small practice helps you be reliably trustworthy?
   - Practice: Make one small, informal promise (no written contract, no oath) this week and keep it; reflect on trust dynamics that followed.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV texts; confirm public settings: Matthew 5 (Sermon on the Mount, public address) and Matthew 23 (public rebuke addressed to crowds and scribes).
- Left: paraphrases only; permission: none.

## Risks
- Risk of appearing to dismiss legal protections or contractual mechanisms—explicitly clarify that the focus is relational integrity, not the elimination of just legal remedies.
- Cultural variation: oath forms and their social meaning vary widely; include context notes for readers in systems where oaths hold civil/legal weight.

## DoD for Chapter 9
- Three spreads drafted with YAML front matter and PD ASV excerpts for the right column.
