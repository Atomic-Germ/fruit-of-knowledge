# Chapter 15 Plan — Prayer and Posture

## Objective
Contrast ritualized, performative prayer postures with Jesus’ public teaching about private prayer, trustworthy patterns (Lord’s Prayer), and persistent petition.

## Spreads (3)
1. Title: Pray in Secret
   - Left (received): “Public displays of devotion prove spiritual health.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 6:5–6 (ASV). Context: Sermon on the Mount instruction to avoid prayer for public show and to pray privately.
   - Tension: Public religious display vs. hidden, honest prayer life.
   - Prompts: Where do you use visible prayer to signal piety? How might private discipline change your interior life? Choose one private practice to sustain.
   - Practice: Designate a daily five‑minute private prayer space for one week.

2. Title: The Lord’s Prayer as Pattern
   - Left (received): “Prayer must be long, impressive, or doctrinally perfect to be effective.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Matt 6:9–13 (ASV). Context: Public teaching offering a concise pattern for prayer (the Lord's Prayer) as part of the Sermon on the Mount.
   - Tension: Performance‑driven prayer vs. concise, communal patterns that orient desires and action.
   - Prompts: Which line of the Lord’s Prayer touches you most? Where does your prayer life need structure? Practice a concise, patterned prayer daily.
   - Practice: Use the Lord’s Prayer as a five‑minute daily framework for one week.

3. Title: Persistent Petition — The Widow and the Judge
   - Left (received): “Prayer is a private plea; persistence shows neediness, not faith.” (paraphrase)
   - Right (Jesus public): Luke 18:1–8 (ASV). Context: Public parable encouraging persistence in prayer and a trust in God’s justice.
   - Tension: Shame about persistent asking vs. faithful persistence that expects God’s action.
   - Prompts: What do you regularly give up asking for? What small, consistent step would make petition possible? Identify one persistent ask to rehearse.
   - Practice: For two weeks, practice a single persistent petition (silent or spoken) with a brief daily check‑in.

## Sources and Permissions
- Right: ASV passages and public pericopes (Matt 6:5–6; Matt 6:9–13; Luke 18:1–8). Publicness confirmed (public_only_check: ok for Sermon and parable settings).
- Left: paraphrases only.

## Risks
- Conflating private prayer with neglect of communal liturgy — include notes on balancing private and public prayer.
- Using the Lord’s Prayer as a magic formula — emphasize the pattern and orientation over rote repetition.

## DoD for Chapter 15
- Three spreads drafted with PD verse refs, concise context notes, three reflection prompts, and one micro‑practice each; public‑only criterion verified by two reviewers.
