This chapter opens the collection's first set of spreads focused on power and leadership. Each spread pairs a common received teaching with a public-domain excerpt of Jesus' words, followed by reflection prompts and a short practice. The aim is to invite readers into concrete, short experiments that test how gospel-shaped practices rework everyday assumptions about authority.
