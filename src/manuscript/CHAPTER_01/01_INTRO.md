There is a particular way this book is intended to be used. Something of a workbook, but not intended to give you the right answer to anything. The basic conviction of the spirit is that you **already know all of this**.
You just need to be invited to remember it, and practice it, in ways that reorient -- that is, repent -- your heart and mind.

This first set of spreads is focused on the ideas of power and leadership. Each spread juxtaposes a common or received teaching in the world of Christianity or greater society against an excerpt of Jesus' words. These are followed by reflective questions and a small practice you can use to actively experience what Jesus meant in his words. The aim is to invite you to take part in meaningful self-experiments that test how gospel-shaped practices bring about the changes we wish to embody.

Below is a map to the three spreads in Chapter 01 and how to use them together over a week:

>
> - Days 1–3: One spread per day.
> - 01.1 Greatness Redefined (Matt 20:25–28; Mark 10:42–45)
>   - Focus: Moves from top-down control to bottom-up service.
>   - Try today: Choose one hidden act that reduces someone else’s burden.
> - 01.2 Authority vs. Status (Matt 23:8–12)
>   - Focus: Untangles titles and true authority.
>   - Try tomorrow: Drop one honor-seeking habit; elevate someone else’s contribution.
> - 01.3 Serving Presence (Luke 22:25–27)
>   - Focus: Presence as service rather than being served.
>   - Try next: Take the lower role in one interaction you'd usually reserve for a junior.
> 
> - Days 4–6: Repeat any one practice daily; note what shifts in you and your context.
> - Day 7: Review your notes; name one assumption about power that changed.
