## Received Teaching
::: aside
"Leaders must exercise authority to maintain order."[^0]
:::

## Jesus' Public Words
::: aside
"Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."[^1]
:::

::: {.right}
## Tension
Ruling over versus serving under.

## Reflection
1. Which words of power appear in your week? Where do you "lord it over" someone?
2. Actively imagine the experience of the least powerful person in your world this week.
3. Act: Choose one **hidden** service that reduces someone else’s burden.

## Practice
Each day, do one unnoticed or uncredited service for a lower-status or lower-powered colleague or neighbor; do not announce it.
