## Received Teaching
> "Leaders must exercise authority to maintain order."
- Source: Representative leadership maxim
- Context: Emphasizes top-down control and enforcement for stability.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
- Reference: Matthew 20:25–28 (ASV); cf. Mark 10:42–45 (ASV)
- Context: Public setting en route to Jerusalem; teaching within hearing of others beyond the Twelve.

## Tension
From ruling over to serving under.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which verbs of power appear in your week? Where do you “lord it over”? 
2. Empathize: Imagine the experience of the least powerful person in your context this week.
3. Act: Choose one hidden service that reduces someone else’s burden.

## Practice
Each day, do one unnoticed service for a lower‑status colleague or neighbor; do not announce it.
