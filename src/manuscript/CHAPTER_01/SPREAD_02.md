# Authority vs. Status

## Received Teaching
> "Titles confer spiritual authority."
- Source: Common practice of honorifics and seats of honor
- Context: Status markers assumed to equal legitimacy.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, even he who is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, even the Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted."
- Reference: Matthew 23:8–12 (ASV)
- Context: Spoken to the crowds and to his disciples.

## Tension
Status titles vs. leveling language of siblings.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do titles shape how you treat or are treated by others?
2. Empathize: Who is overlooked when attention flows to titles?
3. Act: Lower yourself in one interaction this week; practice listening first.

## Practice
Drop one honor-seeking habit (title usage, preferred seat, signature flair) for a week and elevate another’s contribution.

## Notes
- Public crowd context per Matthew 23:1.
