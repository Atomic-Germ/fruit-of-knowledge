As of writing, nearly everything is at stake; the world itself is, at this point, at stake. There are no less than three religions *supposed to* be worshipping the same god, and even more denominations and splits within each over what appears to be nothing meaningful in the end.  

While this book isn't directly targeted outside the christian world, it also isn't intended to offend any well-meaning belief system in any way. Hopefully, the insight you gain will become a change in the world, because a good man once said good and deeply true things, even if you aren't a "christian". And if anyone tells you there's some special requirement only their church can offer; remember that Abram became Abraham when he listened to the personal God who lead him in apparent rebelion. Jesus was not accepted by his own people for a similar reason. There's no need to worry about worldly consequence, when truth is the issue.  

Right now, there are many who come saying that "Jesus is the Christ". Although that sounds like a good thing; we can see visibly that they often don't believe that at all. From a very young age I just saw Jesus as "that guy who seems like a good human being to me". I grew up with Christmas being a literal birthday party dedicated to Jesus, cake and all. I visited many churches; but I wasn't raised in a religion I knew of.  

Rather than anyone else; any influence or expected role model, or even my own father, I chose Jesus as my male rolemodel. Jesus struck me as the only person I could find who felt the same heartbreak I do and always have. This has lead to me being kicked out of churches later on, in trouble in schools for speaking up when a teacher or rule was wrong, and fired from jobs for the same. But what is a life lived in faith without principle and backbone? It's not worth much.  

Everything in your life: your personal faith, community, civic, and every other part of your life, is affected by the lens through which you see the world. My hope is that with this book you might fashion for yourself the lens that best fits your eye, so that you can see the world with a new and powerful clarity. Regardless of religion, Jesus is the person I trust. It's my belief that spreading this idea can change many hearts, and by extension the world.
