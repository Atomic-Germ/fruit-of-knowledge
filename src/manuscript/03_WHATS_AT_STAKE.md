As of writing, nearly everything is at stake; the world itself is, at this point, at stake. There are no less than three religions *supposed to be* worshipping the same god, and even more denominations and splits within each over what appears to be nothing. 

While this book isn't really targeted outside the christian world, it also isn't intended to offend any well-meaning belief system at all. Hopefully, the insight you gain will become a change in the world, because a good man once said good and deeply true things, even if you aren't a "christian".

Right now, there are many who come saying that Jesus is "the Christ". Well, from a very young age I just saw Jesus as "that guy who seems like a good human being to me". Rather than anyone else, I chose Jesus as my male rolemodel. This has lead to me being kicked out of churches, in trouble in schools, and fired from jobs, all due to standing on princible. But what is life and faith without principle and backbone? It's not worth much.

Everything in your life: your personal faith, community, civic, and every other part of your life, is affected by the lens through which you see the world. My hope is that with this book you fashion for yourself the lens that best fits your eye, so that you can see the world with a new and powerful clarity.
