## Received Teaching
> "Ritual observance proves moral superiority."
- Context: Observance used as evidence of righteousness and social standing.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "He spake also this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others... I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other." (Luke 18:9–14 ASV)
- Reference: Luke 18:9–14 (ASV)
- Context: Public parable addressing self‑righteousness in a listening audience.

## Tension
Prideful purity vs. humble repentance that invites restoration.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you rely on observance to claim superiority?
2. Empathize: Who is ashamed by public moral posturing and how does it affect them?
3. Act: Practice one humble admission or small reparative action in public or semi‑public context.

## Practice
Offer one genuine, humble admission of a small failing to a trusted person this week and note the change in your relationships.
