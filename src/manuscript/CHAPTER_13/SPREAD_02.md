# The Woman Who Loved Much

## Received Teaching
> "Sexual or social impurity disqualifies a person from mercy."
- Context: Communities shame and exclude those labeled impure.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment... And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven..." (Luke 7:37–48 ASV)
- Reference: Luke 7:36–50 (ASV)
- Context: Public meal where Jesus interprets the woman's actions as evidence of forgiven love.

## Tension
Exclusion for perceived impurity vs. offering mercy and restoration to the visibly broken.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who in your community is shamed or excluded for perceived impurity?
2. Empathize: What mercy would help restore dignity for that person?
3. Act: Offer a small, sacrificial act of mercy toward someone frequently shamed.

## Practice
This week, perform one discreet, costly act of mercy toward a person your community tends to exclude; reflect privately on the encounter.

## Notes
- Right text: Luke 7:36–50 (ASV); public meal context with Pharisees and witnesses.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
