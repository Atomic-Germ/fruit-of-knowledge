## Received Teaching
> "Ritual purity is the primary measure of holiness."
- Context: Purity systems prioritize external cleanliness and boundary markers.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he called unto him the multitude, and said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile a man." (Mark 7:14–15 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 7:14
201323 (ASV)
- Context: Public teaching in response to debates about washing and impurity.

## Tension
Ritual‑centered holiness vs. heart‑centered ethics that prioritize compassion and accountability.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which purity rules shape who you welcome or exclude?
2. Empathize: Who is harmed by boundary enforcement that ignores need?
3. Act: In one situation this week, prioritize a compassionate exception to a purity boundary where safety allows.

## Practice
Choose a single, low‑risk context and enact a compassionate exception (share food, offer touch/aid, allow participation) and record outcomes.
