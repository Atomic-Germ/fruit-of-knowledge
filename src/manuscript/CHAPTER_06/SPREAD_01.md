# Do Not Be Anxious

## Received Teaching
> "If you’re not worried, you’re not paying attention."
- Source: Vigilance-as-virtue maxim
- Context: Worry framed as responsibility.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on... But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
- Reference: Matthew 6:25–34 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Anxiety as virtue vs. trustful focus on today.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Name your top two provision fears.
2. Empathize: Where do you see “birds and lilies” in your context today?
3. Act: Choose one seek-first action and do it today.

## Practice
Daily: write the worry, then take one concrete seek-first step; release the rest for today.

## Notes
- Avoid shaming; pair trust with action.
