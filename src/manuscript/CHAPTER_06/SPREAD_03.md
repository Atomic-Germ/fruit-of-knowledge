# Fear and Courage

## Received Teaching
> "Fear keeps you safe; avoid storms."
- Source: Safety-first maxim
- Context: Risk framed as imprudence.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> Luke 12:4–7 (ASV): "Be not afraid of them that kill the body... Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell... Ye are of more value than many sparrows."
> Matt 14:27; Mark 6:50 (ASV): "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" spoken amid public‑witnessed storm scenes.
- Reference: Luke 12:4–7; Matt 14:27; Mark 6:50 (ASV)
- Context: Crowd teaching (Luke 12); miracle scenes visible to many.

## Tension
Safety-first fear vs. courage rooted in care and ultimate value.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Name one “storm” you avoid.
2. Empathize: What would “be not afraid” enable for those you serve?
3. Act: Take one small, safe step into that storm.

## Practice
Design a graduated exposure: smallest next step, done this week.

## Notes
- Frame courage as love-informed action, not bravado.
