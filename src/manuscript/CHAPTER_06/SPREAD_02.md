# Ask, Seek, Knock

## Received Teaching
> "Self-reliance only; don’t ask for help."
- Source: Independence-as-strength
- Context: Requests seen as weakness.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone; or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
- Reference: Matthew 7:7–11 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Closed self-sufficiency vs. open-hearted petition.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you refuse to ask despite need?
2. Empathize: Who could respond like a good parent to your request?
3. Act: Make one honest ask today.

## Practice
Each day this week, ask for one concrete help you actually need.

## Notes
- Emphasize openness and relational trust over passivity.
- Reference: Matt 7:7
