# Oaths, Power, and Manipulation

## Received Teaching
> "Invoking sacred witnesses or ritual guarantees protects agreements and enforces social order." (paraphrase)
- Context: Social and legal customs that use sacred referents or ritual formulas to strengthen commitments.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor... Whoso therefore shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein." (Matt 23:16,21–22 ASV)
- Reference: Matt 23:16
201322 (ASV)
- Context: Public rebuke of scribes and Pharisees for casuistry and public manipulation.
- Editorial: Uses ASV (public-domain). Left-sources are paraphrases (permission: none). Verify any verbatim left-side quotes; mark permission: pending if found.

## Tension
Using oaths and sacred guarantees as leverage and exclusion versus locating trust in conscience, accountable relationships, and consistent character.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where have you seen oaths or ritual guarantees used to gain advantage or evade responsibility?
2. Empathize: Who is made vulnerable by systems that privilege sworn guarantees over plain promise-keeping?
3. Act: Where an oath or witness seems customary, how could you instead state a clear commitment that invites mutual accountability?

## Practice
In one situation this week where invoking a witness or sacred formula feels customary, intentionally state your commitment plainly (no oath, no witness) and note the outcome.

## Notes
- Right text: Matt 23:16–22 (ASV). Pericope: Public rebuke to religious leaders; crowd present.
- Left source: paraphrase; permission: none.
