# Trust Without Formality

## Received Teaching
> "Contracts, witnesses, and formal vows are the primary safeguards of truth in relationships and institutions." (paraphrase)
- Context: Legal and organizational cultures that privilege written agreements and sworn testimony.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." (Matt 5:37 ASV)
- Reference: Matt 5:37 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount; public teaching encouraging plainspoken speech.

## Tension
Reliance on contractual and legal safeguards versus cultivating reliability through straight speech and consistent character.

## Reflection
1. Observe: When have you depended on contracts or witnesses instead of building trust through consistent behavior?
2. Empathize: Who benefits from contract-heavy systems and who is disadvantaged by them?
3. Act: What one small habit could you begin to practice that builds your reputation for reliability without formal guarantees?

## Practice
Make one small, informal promise this week (no written contract, no sworn oath) and keep it; journal what made the keeping of that promise possible.

## Notes
- Right text: Matt 5:37 (ASV). Pericope: Sermon on the Mount; public address.
- Left source: paraphrase; permission: none.
