# Say Yes, Say No

## Received Teaching
> "Oaths and vows are necessary to guarantee truth; people only trust promises sealed by an oath." (paraphrase)
- Context: Cultural and institutional practices that treat sworn statements as the primary credibility mechanism.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne... But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." (Matt 5:34,37 ASV)
- Reference: Matt 5:33–37 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount; public teaching addressed to crowds and disciples.

## Tension
Formal oath‑making as the source of reliability versus simple, habitual truthfulness.

## Reflection
1. Observe: When do you add oath‑language to make speech believable?
2. Empathize: Who benefits from formal guarantees, and who is excluded or harmed by them?
3. Act: What small promise can you make this week without invoking an oath, and how will you ensure you keep it?

## Practice
For three days, avoid oath‑language ("I swear," "I promise on...") and intentionally make and keep at least one small commitment using ordinary speech.

## Notes
- Right text: Matt 5:33–37 (ASV). Pericope: Sermon on the Mount; public address.
- Left source: paraphrase; permission: none.
