## Received Teaching

::: aside
"Big breakthroughs are what count; small things don't matter."[^0]
:::

## Jesus' Public Words

::: aside
"He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much."[^1]
:::

## Tension

Chasing the spectacular vs. stewarding the ordinary.

## Reflection

1. Where do you overlook “very little” opportunities for faithfulness?
2. How might God be training you for “much” through a small, repeating task?
3. Act: Choose one small responsibility and elevate its care for a week.

## Practice

Name one recurring, ordinary duty (dishwashing, budgeting, replying). For seven days, perform it as a sacred trust: on time, with attention, and with gratitude.

## Notes

---

[^0]: Common bias toward visibility and scale.
[^1]: **Luke 16:10 (ASV)**; public teaching in the context of stewardship.
