## Received Teaching

::: aside
"Faith belongs in spiritual activities; ordinary life runs on its own logic."[^0]
:::

## Jesus' Public Words

::: aside
"But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."[^1]
:::

## Tension

Compartmentalized piety vs. whole‑life discipleship.

## Reflection

1. Where do you compartmentalize faith (work, home, online)?
2. What would it look like to seek the kingdom first in one ordinary task today?
3. Act: Attach a short prayer of intention to a routine action (unlocking your phone, opening email).

## Practice

Choose one daily habit and reframe it as an act of kingdom‑seeking: name God’s presence, your intention, and one neighbor to bless through it.

## Notes

---

[^0]: Common assumption that spirituality is limited to religious spaces and times.
[^1]: **Matthew 6:33 (ASV)**; public teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.
