This culminating chapter invites you to integrate the practices and insights from the previous sixteen chapters into a cohesive way of being. Rather than introducing new concepts, it focuses on how the various themes—power, presence, community, transformation, and multiplication—work together in the ongoing journey of following Jesus.

Each spread in this chapter revisits a core theme from earlier chapters, showing how they interconnect and support one another. The practices here are designed to help you see your entire life as a field for gospel-shaped experimentation.

Below is a map to the three spreads in Chapter 17 and how to use them together over a week:

::: info
Days 1–3: One spread per day:

17.1 The Integrated Life (Col 3:17)

* Focus: Seeing all of life as an opportunity for gospel practice.
* Try today: Choose one ordinary moment and approach it with intentional presence.

17.2 Patterns of Transformation (2 Cor 3:18)

* Focus: How all the practices work together to form character.
* Try tomorrow: Identify one connection between practices from different chapters.

17.3 Ongoing Faithfulness (Phil 1:6)

* Focus: Trusting in the continuing work of transformation.
* Try next: Commit to one practice from each of three different chapters.

Days 4–6: Rotate through practices from different chapters, noticing how they support each other.

Day 7: Review your notes; name one insight about how the various themes form a unified way of life. Consider how you might continue this journey beyond this workbook.
