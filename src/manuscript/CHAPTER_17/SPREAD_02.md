## Received Teaching

::: aside
"Change comes mainly from willpower and behavior hacks."[^0]
:::

## Jesus' Public Words

::: aside
"For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. ... The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh."[^1]

## Tension

Behavior modification vs. heart‑level renovation.

## Reflection

1. Where do you try to force outcomes without examining roots?
2. What inputs (stories, habits, company) are seeding the “treasure” of your heart?
3. Act: Replace one heart‑shaping input this week (newsfeed, podcast, commute routine) with scripture and prayer.

## Practice

Audit your inputs for one day. Note what increases fear, envy, or contempt. Replace one with a practice that cultivates love, joy, or patience.

## Notes
