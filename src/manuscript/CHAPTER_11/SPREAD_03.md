# Humility Over Display

## Received Teaching
> "Public virtue is a path to influence."
- Context: Virtue performed for status and social capital.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican... I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted." (Luke 18:10–14 ASV)
- Reference: Luke 18:9–14 (ASV)
- Context: Public parable contrasting self‑righteousness and humble repentance.

## Tension
Instrumentalized virtue vs. humility that restores relationship.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which public virtues do you perform for influence?
2. Empathize: Who is harmed when virtue is a performance rather than a posture of care?
3. Act: Offer one unembellished admission of small failing in a public or semi‑public context.

## Practice
This week, offer one unaggrandized thank‑you or admission of mistake in a group and record the response.
