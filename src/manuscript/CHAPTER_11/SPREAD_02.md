## Received Teaching
> "Reforms must be shown to be believed."
- Context: Public reforms and visible change used to prove reformation or repentance.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness. But give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you." (Luke 11:39–41 ASV)
- Reference: Luke 11:39–41 (ASV)
- Context: Public teaching contrasting external compliance with inner corruption.

## Tension
External reform signals vs. internal moral work.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where have you prioritized appearance over internal growth?
2. Empathize: Who suffers when reform is ornamental rather than substantive?
3. Act: Begin one inward habit (daily silence, confession, accountability note) and keep it private for two weeks.

## Practice
Keep a private journal for two weeks noting one interior habit you consistently practiced and what changed.
