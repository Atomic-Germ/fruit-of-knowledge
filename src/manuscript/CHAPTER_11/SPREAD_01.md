# Outward Piety, Inward Decay

## Received Teaching
> "Visible piety proves devotion."
- Context: External markers (dress, speech, ritual) treated as proof of inner faith.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess... Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness." (Matt 23:25–28 ASV)
- Reference: Matthew 23:25–28 (ASV)
- Context: Public denunciation of religious leaders before crowds.

## Tension
Performative religion vs. inward integrity and consistency.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which outward markers do you use to signal devotion?
2. Empathize: How might others experience those markers if the interior life does not match?
3. Act: Convert one public display into a private practice for a week.

## Practice
For seven days, replace a public, performative religious habit (public declaration, ostentatious donation, conspicuous ritual) with a private discipline and journal changes in motive.

## Notes
- Right text: Matt 23:25–28 (ASV); public rebuke of scribes and Pharisees.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
