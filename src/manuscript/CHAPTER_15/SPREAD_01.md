## Received Teaching
> "Public displays of devotion prove spiritual health."
- Context: Visible rituals and broadcasted piety signal spiritual standing.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret..." (Matt 6:6 ASV)
- Reference: Matthew 6:5–6 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount instruction contrasting public, performative prayer with private devotion.

## Tension
Public religious display vs. hidden, honest prayer life.

## Reflection
1. Observe: When do you use visible prayer to signal devotion?
2. Empathize: How might private prayer change your motivations and depth?
3. Act: Designate a five‑minute private prayer time each day for one week.

## Practice
For seven days, keep a daily private five‑minute prayer slot; resist posting about it and note interior changes.
