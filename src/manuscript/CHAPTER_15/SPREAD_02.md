## Received Teaching
> "Prayer must be long, impressive, or doctrinally perfect to be effective."
- Context: Performative prayer practices that value length and rhetorical display.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name..." (Matt 6:9–13 ASV)
- Reference: Matt 6:9
201313 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount providing a concise pattern for communal prayer.
- Editorial: Uses ASV (public-domain). Left-sources are paraphrases (permission: none). Verify any verbatim left-side quotes; mark permission: pending if found.

## Tension
Performance‑driven prayer vs. concise, formative patterns that orient desire and action.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which parts of prayer life are habit and which are heartfelt?
2. Empathize: How might a concise pattern help those new to prayer feel included?
3. Act: Use the Lord’s Prayer as a five‑minute framework for daily prayer this week.

## Practice
For seven days, use the Lord’s Prayer as the structure for a five‑minute daily practice, pausing to personalize each line.
