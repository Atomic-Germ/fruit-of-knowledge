# Persistent Petition — The Widow and the Judge

## Received Teaching
> "Prayer is a private plea; persistence shows neediness, not faith."
- Context: Cultural shaming of persistent asking as lack of sufficiency or faith.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he spake a parable unto them, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint... And shall not God avenge his own elect, that cry unto him day and night? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily." (Luke 18:1,7–8 ASV)
- Reference: Luke 18:1–8 (ASV)
- Context: Public parable urging persistence in prayer and trust in just response.

## Tension
Shame about persistent asking vs. faithful persistence that expects God’s action.

## Reflection
1. Observe: What have you stopped asking for because you assumed silence meant refusal?
2. Empathize: What would consistent, small requests look like in your relationships?
3. Act: Choose one persistent petition to rehearse and sustain for two weeks.

## Practice
For two weeks, practice one persistent petition (daily short prayer, a repeated outreach, or consistent advocacy) and note signs of movement.

## Notes
- Right text: Luke 18:1–8 (ASV); public parable context.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
