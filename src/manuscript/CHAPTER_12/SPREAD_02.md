## Received Teaching
> "Peace at all costs; avoid necessary confrontation."
- Context: Conflict avoidance framed as the primary value.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God." (Matt 5:9 ASV)
- Reference: Matthew 5:9 (ASV)
- Context: Beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount, public address.

## Tension
Avoiding conflict vs. courageous peacemaking that pursues justice and relationship.

## Reflection
1. Observe: When do you avoid conflict that might need address?
2. Empathize: Who is harmed when peacemaking is deferred?
3. Act: Identify one step you can take to initiate a restorative conversation.

## Practice
Initiate one peacemaking conversation this week with a posture of curiosity and repair; plan a neutral setting and a clear desired outcome.
