# Violence and the Kingdom

## Received Teaching
> "Might makes right; power secures the order."
- Context: Political theology that privileges force as the decisive way to maintain order.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world... if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight..." (John 18:36 ASV)
> "Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." (Matt 26:52 ASV)
- Reference: John 18:36; Matthew 26:52 (ASV)
- Context: Public exchange with Pilate (trial scene) and public arrest scene where Jesus reproves violent defense.

## Tension
Political sovereignty through force vs. a kingdom ethic that resists state‑style violence as the primary solution.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you assume coercive force is the default solution?
2. Empathize: Who carries the cost when force is prioritized?
3. Act: Identify one non‑coercive policy, practice, or local support (mediation, community safety initiative) to advocate for or support.

## Practice
Replace one advocacy for force with a practical support action (e.g., donate to or volunteer with community mediation efforts) for 30 days and journal observed effects.

## Notes
- Right texts: John 18:36; Matt 26:52 (ASV). Note contextual differences (Pilate trial vs. arrest); public settings noted.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
