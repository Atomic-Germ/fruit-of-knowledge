# Turn the Other Cheek

## Received Teaching
> "Deterrence and retaliation keep societies safe."
- Context: Security‑first frameworks that justify reciprocal force.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also..." (Matt 5:38–39 ASV)
- Reference: Matthew 5:38–42 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public teaching on responses to injury.

## Tension
Escalation‑based security vs. non‑retaliatory, creative alternatives.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you reflexively choose deterrence or escalation?
2. Empathize: How might a non‑retaliatory response preserve dignity for both parties?
3. Act: Practice a dignity‑preserving, non‑retaliatory response in one tense encounter this week.

## Practice
When slighted, practice a scripted, calm second‑mile response and note what shifted in the interaction.
