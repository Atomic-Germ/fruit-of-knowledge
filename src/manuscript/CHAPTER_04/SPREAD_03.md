# Invite the Unreturning

## Received Teaching
> "Invite those who can help you back; network wisely."
- Source: Social capital logic
- Context: Reciprocity as strategic hospitality.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just."
- Reference: Luke 14:12–14 (ASV)
- Context: Public dinner conversation among guests.

## Tension
Reciprocity networking vs. hospitality toward those who cannot repay.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who is missing from your table who cannot repay?
2. Empathize: What would welcome feel like to them?
3. Act: Plan and schedule a simple meal with those overlooked.

## Practice
Host one meal or act for people who cannot repay; keep it quiet.

## Notes
- Frame as motive shift from networking to mercy.
