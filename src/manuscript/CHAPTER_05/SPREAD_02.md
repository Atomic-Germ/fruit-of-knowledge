# The Last and the First

## Received Teaching
> "Aim for first place; winners lead."
- Source: Competitive success logic
- Context: Leadership equated with winning.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> Mark 9:35 (ASV): "If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all." He then took a child and set him in their midst (vv. 36–37).
- Reference: Mark 9:33
201337 (ASV)
- Context: Teaching to a group with others around.
- Editorial: Uses ASV (public-domain). Left-sources are paraphrases (permission: none). Verify any verbatim left-side quotes; mark permission: pending if found.

## Tension
Upward mobility vs. downward greatness.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you reflexively reach for first place?
2. Empathize: Who is last in your context, and how can you center them?
3. Act: Take the last spot and serve others’ goals in one meeting/event.

## Practice
Intentionally choose last place once a day this week and serve from there.

## Notes
- Keep both sayings in view without harmonizing narratives.
