## Tension
Upward mobility vs. downward greatness.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you reflexively reach for first place?
2. Empathize: Who is last in your context, and how can you center them?
3. Act: Take the last spot and serve others’ goals in one meeting/event.

## Practice
Intentionally choose last place once a day this week and serve from there.

## Notes
- Keep both sayings in view without harmonizing narratives.
