# Choose the Lower Seat

## Received Teaching
> "Sit up front; signal importance."
- Source: Status signaling habits
- Context: Seeking honor and visibility.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "And he spake a parable unto those who were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them, When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him, and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

## Tension
Self-promotion vs. humility that lets others lift you.

## Reflection
1. Observe: What are your seat-seeking habits (literal or figurative)?
2. Empathize: How does your placement affect those with less status?
3. Act: Choose the lower seat and make space for others.

## Practice
All week, take the lower seat/role and highlight others.

## Notes
- Tie to humility without courting false modesty.
