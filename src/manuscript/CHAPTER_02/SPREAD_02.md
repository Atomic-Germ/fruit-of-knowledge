## Received Teaching

::: aside
"Love people who love you; protect yourself from enemies."[^12]
:::

## Jesus’ Public Words

::: aside
"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy: but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust... Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."[^13]

## Tension

Reciprocal love vs. indiscriminate, enemy‑embracing love.

## Reflection

1. Observe: Where do you withhold kindness from those who oppose you?
2. Empathize: What would you hope for if your worst moment defined you to others?
3. Act: Pray blessing over one “enemy” and take one non‑retaliatory step toward good.

:::

## Practice

For three days, name one person you resent. Each day: pray for their good, speak no ill of them, and do one small unseen kindness that removes harm.

::: aside
Previous: [02.1 Who Is My Neighbor?](./SPREAD_01.md). Next: [02.3 Forgive Without Counting](./SPREAD_03.md). On Days 4–6, repeat whichever practice most stretches your love.

## Notes

[^12]: Common reciprocity ethic; love as mutual exchange within in‑group boundaries.
