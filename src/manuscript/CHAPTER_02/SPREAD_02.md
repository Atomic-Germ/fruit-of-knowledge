# Non‑Retaliation

## Received Teaching
> "Stand your ground; respond in kind to deter harm."
- Source: Common deterrence rationale.
- Context: Reciprocity framed as justice.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
- Reference: Matthew 5:38–42 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon teaching to the public.

## Tension
Lex talionis vs. creative, non‑coercive response.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you tend to escalate or repay in kind?
2. Empathize: What preserves both your dignity and theirs without retaliation?
3. Act: Choose a second‑mile response in one tense interaction.

## Practice
For one week, whenever slighted, practice a non‑retaliating, dignity‑preserving action.

## Notes
- Note: non‑retaliation ≠ passivity; invite creative alternatives.
