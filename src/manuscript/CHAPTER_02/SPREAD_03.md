# Who Is My Neighbor?

## Received Teaching
> "Help your own first; outsiders aren’t your responsibility."
- Source: Common boundary‑limited charity principle.
- Context: Prioritizes in‑group obligations over out‑group mercy.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30–37, ASV): a man is robbed; religious passersby avoid; a Samaritan shows mercy and provides care.
- Reference: Luke 10:29–37 (ASV)
- Context: Public exchange with a lawyer, followed by a parable to listeners.

## Tension
Boundary‑limited care vs. mercy‑defined neighbor.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who functions as your “Samaritan/outsider” today?
2. Empathize: What mercy would you want if you were in their place?
3. Act: Share time, money, or advocacy with one out‑group person.

## Practice
Plan and execute one act of mercy toward an outsider this week.

## Notes
- Keep parable summary brief; encourage reading full ASV text.
