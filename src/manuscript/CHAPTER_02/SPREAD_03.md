## Received Teaching

::: aside
"Forgive only when they deserve it or apologize."[^14]
:::

## Jesus’ Public Words

::: aside
"Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven."[^15]

## Tension

Merited forgiveness vs. mercy given beyond deserts.

## Reflection

1. Observe: Where do you keep a ledger of wrongs?
2. Empathize: When have you been forgiven beyond what you could repay?
3. Act: Choose one debt to release today without demanding apology or payback.

:::

## Practice

For a week, keep a “no-ledger” journal: whenever a minor offense occurs, write it once, release it in prayer, and refrain from revisiting it in speech or thought. If the harm is serious, pair forgiveness with wise boundaries—mercy is not permission.
