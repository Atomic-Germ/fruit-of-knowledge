# Love Your Enemies

## Received Teaching
> "Protect your own; enemies deserve what they get."
- Source: Common maxim prioritizing in‑group.
- Context: Loyalty framed as virtue that excludes opponents.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy: but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you; that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same? Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
- Reference: Matthew 5:43–48 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Preferential love vs. indiscriminate love.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who falls into your “enemy/opponent” category right now?
2. Empathize: What would blessing them look like from their perspective?
3. Act: Offer one concrete good to an opponent this week.

## Practice
Daily: speak a blessing and perform one small good deed toward an opponent.

## Notes
- Keep ASV wording; avoid harmonization.
