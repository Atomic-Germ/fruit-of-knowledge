This chapter aims to impart an understanding of love _agape_ (ah-gah-pay); the selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional love that reflects the nature of divine love. We will explore its significance in our decidedly human relationships and present **practicable** ways to nuture and cultivate agape love in our own decidedly human hearts -- imperfect though it is.

Most readers will feel hesitant or resistant to exercises that ask for a true emotional investment and experience. In this chapter the exercises demand that we behave in ways that may be counterintuitive or feel strange to our natural inclinations. And that's again because we are so decidedly human.

It is crucial to approach this chapter with an open mind and a willingness to engage in self-reflection and personal growth. Embodying the principles of agape love can lead to profound changes in how we relate to others and ourselves, and a compassionate worldview more in line with Jesus.

In trying to more consciously understand and more thoroughly embody the intention we all know to be true in our hearts, we can more fully experience and enjoy being a creature of love. The very mold and model for humanity was _always_ meant to be love, for its own cherished sake.

This set of spreads works just like the Chapter 01 set.
