# The Fruit of The Knowledge

## Eating the Fruit

By following the pattern of Jesus' own authoritative reinterpretations of scripture and popular tradition, **"You have heard it said… but *I* say to you"**, we can see his own understanding on anything he spoke of, and allow that to reenforce what every soul born into the world truly already knows. 

This cannot be directly told to you, or guided effectively. But, as it is said, **he is** the truth, and **he is** the word. That is to say, he was showing the example of what a person who has opened their eyes looks like. If we can't take his word for truth above all else, especially above the established churches, are we not taking the name Christian only for vanity's sake? We know that "Do not take the Lord's name in vain" isn't about swearing, but rather about using the name of Jesus to justify our own very un-Jesus-like behaviors and promising ourselves forgiveness.

For an example of the way Jesus lived scripture, we can look at what he said of the sabbath *(Mark 2:23-28)*, divorce *(Matthew 19:3-9)*, and his delivery of the greatest commandments *(Matthew 22:36-40)*. The scriptures (OT) were established long before him, but he very boldly and bravely stood for what he knew to be right, because of his *direct* knowledge of right and wrong. A knowledge that he accused us all of having, but being too afraid to stand for it.

According to Jesus, right and wrong, or Good and Evil, is  knowledge we inherently share and are indeed cursed with as humans. He answers the scriptures with *his own love, mercy, and justice* in the face of whatever ritual, law or tradition may be offended and the consequences. Can we say we are Christian if we are any less courageous? Apparently, the hypocrites do think so.

Teachings have been established and reestablished and set in tradition. Other teachings have been deliberately misrepresented over time to serve the goals of some power or another. Instead of correcting anything as *I* see it, it is my intent to present a tool for you to apply to *any* thought for which you may seek clarity, if  you honestly want it. Most do not, most would rather not feel the weight of it. But, if you do, this is a lens through which you can see the truth of any matter.

Jesus' actual spoken words while walking the Earth alive are the formative words of this work. I will limit my quoting of Jesus to mostly those words, because they have two or three witnesses; a kind of confirmation for spiritual matters. I want to allow Jesus as he presented himself to be our judge, regardless of any other influence. If what is written doesn't conflict with what Jesus said, it passes through and we can see it with clarity, like filtered water.

The core and unchanging principle throughout this book and in all interpretations through this lens is simple. If it contraditcs Jesus, Jesus wins. This is the antidote to the great deception, the delusional fog that has been cast over the eyes of so many. If it contradicts Jesus, it is false, no matter how popular or accepted it may be. If it agrees with Jesus, it is true, no matter how unpopular or rejected it may be. In this way, you can understand the heart of the man you may call your Lord and know the truth. 

And if you do not call him your Lord, if you don't even see a need for any kind of religious or spiritual framework, you can still know the personal truth of a good man who once wanted to help, among billions who never did.

You understand right from wrong, and you can feel it already. If you eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, your eyes will be opened and you will see it as well as you can feel it. You will see through the great deception that the world is under, and the confusion of the churches and religions. You will grow in yourself and come closer to the one who made you. Or maybe you'll die? You will certainly be held accountable for your actions either way, and the consequences of those actions. But you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. 

If you don't want that, don't eat the fruit. But if you do, take it and eat.
