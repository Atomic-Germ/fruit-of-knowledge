So you've chosen to eat the fruit, knowing what it is? In a sense, there is a death that comes with following the pattern and path of Jesus, who in scripture has been called the new Light Bringer, or "Lucifer"; the one who opens our eyes.  

Jesus challenged our own interpretations of scripture and popular tradition; **"You have heard it saidâ€¦ but *I* say to you"**. We can see his own understanding on anything he spoke of, and allow that to reenforce what every soul born into the world truly already knows, and not forsake that gift by not hearing it. Yes this comes with a kind of death of a base part of yourself; but it is not the one we fear. Rather, it is the kind that brings about a change of the mind, the meaning of "Repent".  

This cannot be directly told to you, or guided by a living person; Jesus showed us that by trying to. But, as it is said, **He Is** the truth, and **He Is** the word, and most importantly and most telling, **He Is The Life** and the Way. That is to say, he was showing the complete example of what a person who has had their eyes opened looks like. If we can't take his word for truth above all else, especially above the established churches, are we not taking the name Christian only for some organization's sake?  

We know that "Do not take the Lord's name in vain" isn't about swearing, but rather about using the name of Jesus to justify our own very un-Jesus-like behaviors and promising ourselves forgiveness; As becomming married and yet going on as if single and humiliating the one whose name you took.  

For an example of the way Jesus lived scripture, we can look at what he said of the sabbath[^0], divorce[^1], and his delivery of the greatest commandments[^2]. The scriptures (OT) were established long before him, but he very boldly and bravely stood for what he knew to be right, because of his *direct* knowledge of right and wrong. A knowledge that he has accused us all of having, but still being too afraid to stand for it.

According to Jesus right and wrong, or Good and Evil, is  knowledge we inherently share in our hearts and are indeed *cursed with* as humans. He answers the scriptures with *his own* love, mercy, and justice in the face of whatever ritual, law or tradition may be offended and the consequences thereof. Can we say we are Christian if we are any less courageous? Apparently, the churches have sat in comfort long enough that they do think so. To think that tradition is what he called for is to miss the point of communion.  

Teachings have been established and reestablished and set in tradition, couched in mythology and obscure ritual. Other teachings have been deliberately misrepresented over time to serve the goals of some political power or another from emporers to popes. Instead of correcting anything as *I* see it, it is my intent to present a tool for you to apply to *any* thought for which you may seek the clarity brought by Jesus, if  you honestly want it. Most do not, most would rather not feel the weight of it, because it certainly *is* a weight. But, if you do, if this is a burdon you want to share with him, this is a lens through which you can see the truth right and wrong in all things, regardless of consequence.

Jesus' actual spoken words while walking the Earth alive are the formative words of this work. I will limit my quoting of Jesus to mostly those words, because they have two or three witnesses[^3]; a kind of confirmation for spiritual matters. I want to allow Jesus as he presented *himself* to be our judge here, regardless of any other influence. That is my open bias. If what is told to you doesn't conflict with what Jesus said, it passes through like filtered water.

The core and unchanging principle throughout this book and in all interpretations through this lens is simple. If it contraditcs Jesus, Jesus wins. This is the antidote to the great deception, the delusional fog that has been cast over the eyes of us, by the apparent will of God. The Truth is that if it contradicts Jesus, it is false, no matter how popular or accepted it may be.  

If it agrees with Jesus, it is true, no matter how unpopular or rejected it may be. And if it appears to agree with Jesus, you already know in your heart if it truly does or if someone just wants it to. In this way, you can understand the heart of the man you might be calling your Lord, and know *His* truth. If you do not call him your Lord, or if you don't even see a need for any kind of religious or spiritual framework, you can still know the personal truth and heart of a good man who once wanted to help, among billions who never did. In a world of terrible influences, he's a legitimately good one.  

You understand right from wrong, and you can feel it already, or at least you could once as a child if you have put it away now. If you eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, your eyes will be opened and you will see; and in seeing you will feel a little death. You will see through the great deception that the world is under, and the confusion of the churches and religions. You will grow in yourself and come closer to the one who made you. And you will break your heart for the world's condition. You will certainly be held accountable from within for your actions either way, and the consequences of those actions.  

But you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
