## Common Teaching

We must have enough resources, skills, or capacity before we can make a meaningful contribution.

## Jesus' Words

> "They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. And he said, Bring them hither to me." (Matt 14:16–18 ASV)

## Reflection

- What do you consider "not enough" to offer?
- How does Jesus transform our limited offerings into abundance?
- Where are you holding back because you feel inadequate?

## Practice

Identify one resource—time, skill, possession, or encouragement—that you've considered too small to share. Offer it today with the prayer, "Jesus, multiply this as you see fit." Notice what happens when you release control of the outcome.
