## Common Teaching

Significant change requires significant resources, platforms, and visibility.

## Jesus' Words

> "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof." (Matt 13:31–32 ASV)

## Reflection

- What small beginnings have you dismissed as insignificant?
- How does God's economy value hidden faithfulness over visible success?
- Where might you be waiting for "big" opportunities while missing small ones?

## Practice

Choose one small act of faithfulness you can commit to this week—a daily prayer, a regular encouragement, a hidden service. Notice how consistency in small things builds something larger over time.
