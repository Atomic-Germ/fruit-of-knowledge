This final chapter invites you to consider how the fruit of knowledge, once tasted, cannot remain a private possession. The patterns of power, presence, and practice you've explored are meant to be shared and multiplied in community. Each spread examines how personal transformation becomes communal transformation, and how the kingdom grows through ordinary acts of faithfulness.

Below is a map to the three spreads in Chapter 16 and how to use them together over a week:

::: info
Days 1–3: One spread per day:

16.1 Bearing Fruit in Season (John 15:1–8)

* Focus: Abiding as the source of lasting fruitfulness.
* Try today: Identify one "branch" in your life that needs pruning for greater health.

16.2 The Mustard Seed Kingdom (Matt 13:31–32)

* Focus: Small beginnings with expansive impact.
* Try tomorrow: Invest 15 minutes in something small that could grow.

16.3 Multiplying Loaves (Matt 14:13–21)

* Focus: What we offer, however small, becomes enough in Jesus' hands.
* Try next: Share one resource you've been holding back.

Days 4–6: Repeat any one practice daily; notice how small acts accumulate.

Day 7: Review your notes; name one way your understanding of "fruitfulness" has expanded. Consider how you might invite others into similar practices.
