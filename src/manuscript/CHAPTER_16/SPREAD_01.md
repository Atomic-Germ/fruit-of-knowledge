## Common Teaching

Productivity and measurable outcomes are the primary indicators of spiritual health and ministry success.

## Jesus' Words

> "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit." (John 15:1–2 ASV)

## Reflection

- What does it mean to "abide" rather than "achieve"?
- How might pruning feel like loss but actually create space for greater life?
- Where are you trying to produce fruit through effort rather than connection?

## Practice

Today, identify one commitment, relationship, or activity that drains more energy than it gives life. Prayerfully consider what "pruning" might look like—not as rejection, but as making space for what truly matters.
