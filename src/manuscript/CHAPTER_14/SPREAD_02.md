# The Last Shall Be First

## Received Teaching
> "Leaders earn favor by upward mobility and visibility."
- Context: Careerist and visibility-driven leadership norms.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them... If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all." (Mark 9:35 ASV)
> "And Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven..." (Matt 18:1–5 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 9:33
201337 (ASV); Matt 18:1
20135 (ASV)
- Context: Public discussions about greatness and status among followers.
- Editorial: Uses ASV (public-domain). Left-sources are paraphrases (permission: none). Verify any verbatim left-side quotes; mark permission: pending if found.

## Tension
Visibility-driven advancement vs. inversion of greatness through humble service.

## Reflection
1. Observe: In what ways do you seek visibility as a path to influence?
2. Empathize: Who is overlooked when visibility defines leadership?
3. Act: Take a listening role and surface someone else's idea in a meeting.

## Practice
Lead by attending for one week: in one meeting each day, prioritize listening and elevating others’ contributions rather than speaking to be seen.
