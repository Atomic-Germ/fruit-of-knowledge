# Greatness as Service

## Received Teaching
> "Effective leaders must wield authority and direct outcomes."
- Context: Leadership manuals and organizational norms that prioritize command structures.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are reputed to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you..." (Mark 10:42–44 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 10:42–45; Matt 20:25–28 (ASV)
- Context: Public teaching in response to discussions about status among his followers.

## Tension
Command‑and‑control leadership vs. servant leadership that seeks others' flourishing.

## Reflection
1. Observe: What leadership habits assume control and oversight?
2. Empathize: How would your team or community feel if leadership prioritized serving them?
3. Act: Choose a leadership task to perform without directing others and note what changes.

## Practice
For one week, accept a task you would normally delegate and perform it as service without publicizing it.

## Notes
- Right texts: Mark 10:42–45; Matt 20:25–28 (ASV); public teaching context.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
