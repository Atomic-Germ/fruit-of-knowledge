## Received Teaching
> "Leadership requires self‑promotion and sacrifice for personal glory."
- Context: Narratives that valorize self‑advertised sacrifice as a route to influence.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he called the people unto him with his disciples also, and saith unto them, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me..." (Mark 8:34 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 8:34
201338 (ASV)
- Context: Public teaching to crowds and disciples about costly discipleship.
- Editorial: Uses ASV (public-domain). Left-sources are paraphrases (permission: none). Verify any verbatim left-side quotes; mark permission: pending if found.

## Tension
Self‑promotional sacrifice vs. sacrificial service aimed at others’ flourishing.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Which sacrifices in your leadership are performed for recognition?
2. Empathize: Who benefits when sacrifice is for others rather than self‑glory?
3. Act: Commit to one sustained, unpopular task for your community’s good without announcing it.

## Practice
For two weeks, take on a task that is necessary but unrewarded (mentoring, routine maintenance, admin labor) and intentionally do it without seeking public credit.
