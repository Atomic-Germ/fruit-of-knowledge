I see **deeply confused** Christians in churches being fed delusions by those who are meant to minister to them. Constantly they're trying to see through the fog of the scriptures that are split into disconnected passages, and hear through the opinions and views and motives of teachers and what pseudo-christians. Those would be the hipocrites Jesus warned of so much. They are confused because they are not being taught the truth, but rather what others think the truth is. This is a problem that has existed since the beginning of the church, and it is only getting worse.

The problem at its core is that people have no idea as to what the fruit was that started all of this. The fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. They have no idea what it is, or what it does, or how to get it. They have no idea that it is the very thing that Jesus came to give us, and that it is the very thing that the enemy has been trying to take from us since the beginning.

This is the fruit of the **knowledge of good and evil**. It is the knowledge of what is good and what is evil, and how to discern between the two. It is the reason that the first ones had such intense shame before the God they realized they had disobeyed. It is the reason that they hid from Him, and covered themselves with the leaves from that same tree; which was a fig tree (Gen 3:7). It is the reason that they were cast out of paradise; it was the paradise of innocence. The bliss of ignorance as to right and wrong, and accountability.

At some point, we have to grow up, and to stand in the sight of the one who judges us all. We have to take responsibility for our actions, and the consequences of those actions. We have to confess to already knowing how to discern between what is good and what is evil. 

If it is Jesus of Nazareth you say you follow, this was his gift to you. This message. This **is the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil**.
