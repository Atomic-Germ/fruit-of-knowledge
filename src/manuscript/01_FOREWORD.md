I see **deeply confused** Christians in churches Struggling to see the Truth in a darkened mirror whose pieces are split into disconnected passages and filtered through the understandings, opinions, views, bias, and ambitions, of teachers and marketers. Those would be the hipocrites Jesus warned of so much, or else the blinded leaders spoken of as well.  

The problem, arguably the only _true_ problem, is inherent to human life. People have no idea as to what that fruit that started all of this chaos even represented. The **Fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Evil**; that is to say **the result of knowing right from wrong**; that is, the "conscience" or even the very nature of The Spirit we are given. They have no idea what it is, or what it does, or how to get it, and often even why they might want to. They have no idea that it is the very thing that Jesus came to give us, and that it is the very thing that the enemy has been trying to take from us since the beginning. **We** were always the enemy.  

This is the knowledge of what is good and what is evil, and how to discern between the two. It is the reason that the first ones had such intense shame before the God they realized had always watched and always listened to them. It is the reason that they hid from Him, and covered themselves with the leaves from that same tree; which was a fig tree[^00] (Gen 3:7). It is the reason that they were cast out of paradise; it was the paradise of innocence. The bliss of ignorance as to right and wrong, and accountability.  

At some point, we have to grow up, and to stand in the sight of the one who judges us all. We have to take responsibility for our actions, and the consequences of those actions. We have to confess to already knowing how to discern between what is good and what is evil, and that we each have our own agency with which to do either good or evil at will.  

If it is Jesus of Nazareth you say you follow, this was his gift to you. This message. This **is the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil** which you already have.

[^00]:Gen 3:7 --- The fig tree is significant because it is the only tree mentioned by name in the entire Genesis creation account. It is also the tree that Jesus cursed in the New Testament, symbolizing the judgment. "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked"
