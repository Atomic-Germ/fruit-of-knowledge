## Received Teaching
::: aside
"Worry is responsible; planning requires constant vigilance."[^14]
:::


## Jesus’ Public Words
::: aside
"Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. [...] Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. [...] O ye of little faith Be not therefore anxious [...] Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."[^15]
:::

## Tension
Anxiety-driven control vs. trust with focused action.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Name your core provision fear this week.
2. Empathize: What do the “birds and lilies” look like in your context?
3. Act: Choose one seek-first action and do it today.

## Practice
Daily: write your worry, then take one concrete seek-first step; release the rest for today.
