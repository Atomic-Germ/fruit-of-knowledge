# Anxiety and Provision

## Received Teaching
> "Worry is responsible; planning requires constant vigilance."
- Source: Common prudence framing
- Context: Anxiety treated as necessary for provision.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life? And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."
- Reference: Matthew 6:25–34 (ASV)
- Context: Sermon on the Mount, public.

## Tension
Anxiety-driven control vs. trust with focused action.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Name your core provision fear this week.
2. Empathize: What do the “birds and lilies” look like in your context?
3. Act: Choose one seek-first action and do it today.

## Practice
Daily: write your worry, then take one concrete seek-first step; release the rest for today.

## Notes
- Pair trust with action to avoid passivity readings.
