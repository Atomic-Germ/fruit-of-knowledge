## Received Teaching
::: aside
"Build financial security first; give when you can."[^12]
:::

## Jesus’ Public Words
::: aside
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also. The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness! No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."[^13]

## Tension
Security-through-accumulation vs. loyalty to a different treasure.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where does your heart follow your money this month?
2. Empathize: How do those with less experience your spending priorities?
3. Act: Reallocate one discretionary expense toward quiet generosity.

## Practice
This week, automate a small, recurring gift that reduces your discretionary spend.
