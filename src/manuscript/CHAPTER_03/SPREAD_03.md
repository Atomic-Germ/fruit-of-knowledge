## Received Teaching
> "Maximize returns; bigger stores mean safety."
- Source: Common accumulation logic
- Context: Safety equated with storage and growth.

## Jesus’ Public Words
> "And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry. But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."

## Tension
Life-in-possessions vs. being rich toward God.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where are your “barns” growing beyond need?
2. Empathize: Who could be helped by what you store?
3. Act: Set a clear ‘enough’ line and give the surplus.

## Practice
Share or sell one stored surplus item and give proceeds quietly this week.

## Notes
- Note crowd setting (v.13); emphasize “rich toward God.”
