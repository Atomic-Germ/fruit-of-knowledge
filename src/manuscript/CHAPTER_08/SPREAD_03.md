## Received Teaching
> "Observance of rituals and rules expresses faithfulness; mercy is secondary to correct practice." (paraphrase)
- Context: Ritual-centered religious life that prizes right procedures.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent." (Matt 12:7 ASV; cf. Matt 12:1–8)
- Reference: Matthew 12:1–8 (ASV)
- Context: Public controversy with Pharisees over disciples plucking grain and Jesus' healing on the sabbath; Jesus cites Hosea to privilege mercy.

## Tension
Ritual correctness and rule observance versus mercy as the Sabbath's and God's intention.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Where do you place ritual or procedure ahead of attending to someone's dignity or need?
2. Empathize: How might those on the receiving end experience ritualized care that misses mercy?
3. Act: What is one ritual practice you can alter this week to make space for mercy?

## Practice
For one week, choose one ritual habit (meeting checklist, formal greetings, liturgical formula) and intentionally adapt it in one concrete situation to prioritize mercy and human flourishing.
