# Sabbath for People

## Received Teaching
> "Sabbath means strict rest: rules must be followed even when a human need arises." (paraphrase)
- Context: Institutional emphasis on holiness expressed as strict rest and avoidance of labor.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: So the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath." (Mark 2:27–28 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 2:27–28 (ASV)
- Context: Public dispute in the grainfields; Jesus answers critics who condemn his disciples for plucking grain on the sabbath while traveling with others present.

## Tension
From rule‑first Sabbath observance to a Sabbath centered on human need and mercy.

## Reflection
1. Observe: When have you or your community prioritized rule keeping over meeting a person's immediate need?
2. Empathize: Who is most likely to be harmed when rules are enforced without regard to human vulnerability?
3. Act: What one small accommodation can you make this week to prioritize a person's need over strict adherence?

## Practice
For three days this week, respond to one small, practical human need (share a meal, make a short visit, cover an errand) even if it means bending a routine or rule you normally follow.

## Notes
- Right text: Mark 2:27–28 (ASV). Pericope context: grainfields dispute; public setting with critics present.
- Left source: paraphrase; permission: none.
