# Welcoming Children and the Lowly

## Received Teaching
> "Children and low‑status people wait their turn and should not disrupt leaders."
- Context: Deference rules that keep the marginalized at the periphery.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And they were bringing little children to him, that he should touch them: but the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not..." (Mark 10:13–16 ASV)
- Reference: Mark 10:13–16; Matthew 19:13–15 (ASV)
- Context: Public scene where Jesus rebukes disciples for excluding children and blesses them.

## Tension
Order‑first hospitality vs. radical welcome that centers the overlooked.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who is routinely sidelined in your gatherings?
2. Empathize: How would centering them change the atmosphere and decisions?
3. Act: Reconfigure one meeting or social moment to intentionally center someone normally marginalized.

## Practice
Rearrange one gathering this week (seat plan, agenda item, invitation list) to intentionally prioritize someone usually overlooked.

## Notes
- Right texts: Mark 10:13–16; Matt 19:13–15 (ASV); public setting.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
