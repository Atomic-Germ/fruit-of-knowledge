# Eating with Sinners

## Received Teaching
> "We keep company with those like us; outsiders are a liability."
- Context: In‑group preservation logic that treats association with outsiders as risk.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners sat also with him and his disciples... But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why doth your Master eat with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick." (Matt 9:10–12 ASV)
- Reference: Matthew 9:10–13 (ASV)
- Context: Public meal scene; Jesus is criticized for table fellowship.

## Tension
Protecting the in‑group vs. table fellowship that intentionally invites the excluded.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who sits outside your table or conversation circles?
2. Empathize: What would it cost you to welcome one of them in?
3. Act: Invite one person outside your usual circle to share a simple meal or conversation.

## Practice
This week, share an unadvertised meal or conversation with someone you would normally avoid; listen without agenda.

## Notes
- Right text: Matt 9:10–13 (ASV); pericope public meal and critique by Pharisees.
- Left source paraphrased; permission: none.
