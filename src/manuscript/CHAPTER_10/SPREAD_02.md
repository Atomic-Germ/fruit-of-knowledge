# Lost and Found (Parables of Recompense)

## Received Teaching
> "Belonging is earned by proving worth or conformity."
- Context: Communities prize merit, conformity, and earned credibility for inclusion.

## Jesus' Public Words
> "Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them..." (Luke 15:1 ASV)
> "Which of you, having an hundred sheep, if he hath lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?..." (Luke 15:4 ASV)
> (Parable of the Prodigal Son condensed): A lost son returns and is received; the elder brother objects — Jesus uses parables to justify mercy toward the excluded.
- Reference: Luke 15:1
20137; 11
201332 (ASV)
- Context: Public parables addressing criticism about receiving sinners; told to listening crowds.

## Tension
Merit‑based belonging vs. merciful outreach that restores the lost.

## Reflection
1. Observe: Who is kept at the edge of your circle for not measuring up?
2. Empathize: What would return and restoration look like for them?
3. Act: Identify one concrete, low‑cost gesture to welcome someone who has been excluded.

## Practice
This week, perform one hospitable, non‑judgmental gesture toward someone you would normally exclude (invite for coffee, drop off a meal, offer practical help) and reflect on the interaction.

## Notes
- Right texts: Luke 15:1–7; 11–32 (ASV); pericope public parables in response to murmuring.
