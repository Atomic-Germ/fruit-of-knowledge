## Received Teaching
::: aside
"This appears in the left column by default."
:::

## Jesus' Public Words
::: aside
"This appears in the right column by default."
:::

::: {.right}
## Custom Analysis
This section would normally be classified as "right" by default, but we're explicitly placing it on the right to ensure it appears there even if the classification logic changes.
:::

::: {.left}
## Special Reflection
Normally "Reflection" goes to the right column, but this particular reflection needs to be on the left for visual balance with the facing page.
:::

## Tension
This goes left by default (standard behavior).

## Practice
This also goes left by default (standard behavior).

## Notes
These notes appear on the right.
